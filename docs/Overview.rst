Overview
========

**PyAMS** (Python for Analog and Mixed Signals) is an open-source computer-aided design 
(CAD) system designed to simplify the simulation of electronic circuits and the modeling 
of analog elements using the **pyams_lib** library, along with custom-designed symbols.

Key Features:
- Free and open-source, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
- Supports detailed operating point analysis (OP), DC analysis, and time-domain analysis.
- Planned support for frequency-domain analysis in future releases.
- Interactive visualization of simulation results using a waveform viewer based on **Plotly**.
- Enables behavioral modeling of analog elements and custom circuit designs.

PyAMS is a powerful tool for engineers and researchers, providing a user-friendly interface and robust simulation capabilities for analog and mixed-signal systems.
