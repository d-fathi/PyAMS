Python Selection for Simulation
===============================

The **Python selection** option allows the user to choose any Python version 
and add it to PyAMS.  

To do this:  

1. Copy the desired Python interpreter into the ``Python`` folder inside PyAMS 
   (see :numref:`figure1`).  
2. Open PyAMS and select the Python version you want to use for electronic 
   circuit analysis (see :numref:`figure2`).

.. note::

   This flexibility makes it possible to work with different Python versions 
   depending on the packages or features you need.
