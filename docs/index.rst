================================


**************
What is PyAMS?
**************

**PyAMS (Python for Analog and Mixed Signals)** is an open-source software tool designed to simplify the simulation 
of electronic circuits and the modeling of analog elements using the ``pyams_lib`` library. 
It is developed with Python 3+, and currently supports Windows, with plans for Linux and macOS in the future. the interface created 
using ElectronJS and NodeJs.

The main features of PyAMS include:

- **Circuit Design and Simulation**:
  - Drawing circuits using a schematic editor.
  - Simulating circuits in various modes of operation.
  - Displaying simulation results in a waveform editor or using probes.

- **Modeling and Customization**:
  - Creating custom symbols for electronic models.
  - Developing new PyAMS models for electrical components using ``pyams_lib``.

- **Performance and Licensing**:
  - Uses PyPy for simulation acceleration.
  - Licensed under *GPLv3*, ensuring it remains free and open-source.

PyAMS is a powerful tool for engineers and researchers working with analog and mixed-signal systems.
