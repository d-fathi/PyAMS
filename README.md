PyAMS: Python for Analog and Mixed Signals

**************
What is PyAMS?
**************

PyAMS is a software used to simplify modeling analog elements and simulate electronic circuit using Python
The objectives of PyAMS is:

*	Drawing circuit by schematic (CAD approach: IDEPyAMS.py);
*	Creating new PyAMS models of electrical elements by using Python language;
*	Creating new symbols for models;
*	Simulating the circuit in the selected mode of operation (future);
*	Presenting simulation results in a dedicated waveform editor (future) and probe;
* Simulating the circuit by AppPyAMS commands (future);
* PyAMS used Python3+ and works on  Linux, Windows, and OSX.
* **Licensed under:** PyAMS is free to use. No license is necessary .
